# imaginery number

a = 3 + 4j
print(a.real)  # Outputs: 3 (real part)
print(a.imag)  # Outputs: 4 (imaginary part)
print(abs(a))  # Outputs: 5.0 (magnitude of the complex number)




x = range(6)
print(x[0])
print(x)
# - Indexing – Helps in iterating through lists or other iterable objects.
# - Generating sequences – Useful when creating structured number sequences.
# - Reducing memory usage – Unlike lists, range() generates numbers on demand (lazy evaluation), making it more efficient.
